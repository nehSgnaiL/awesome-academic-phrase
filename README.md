#### Report
#### A spectacular superconductor claim is making news. Here’s why experts are doubtful [(ADRIAN CHO, 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adk0021)

- "This week, social media has been [aflutter](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/aflutter) over a claim for a new superconductor that works not only well above room temperatures, but also at [ambient](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/ambient) pressure.
If true, the discovery would be one of the biggest ever in condensed matter physics and could [usher](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/usher) in all sorts of technological marvels, such as levitating vehicles and perfectly efficient electrical grids.
...
On the other hand, he says, researchers at Argonne and elsewhere are already trying to [replicate](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/replicate) the experiment.
...
What’s more, the disorder introduced by the doping ought to further [suppress](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/suppress) superconductivity.
...
How will this **be sorted out**?
The big question will be whether anybody can reproduce the observations.

- "...
Many other AI search engine systems adopt a similar [strategy](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/strategy),
...
Elsevier has also cut down the unpredictability of its AI by picking a low setting for the bot’s ‘temperature’ — a measure of how often it chooses to [deviate](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/deviate) from the most [plausible](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/plausible) words in its response.
...
Might users simply copy and paste the bot’s paragraphs into their own papers, effectively [plagiarizing](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/plagiarize) the tool?
...
Elsevier has so far [tackled](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/tackle) this with guidance that asks researchers to use the summaries responsibly, he says. Khan points out that funders and publishers have [issued](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/issue) similar guidance, asking for transparent [disclosure](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/disclosure) if LLMs are used in,

#### Is Fukushima wastewater release safe? What the science says [(Bianca Nogrady, 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-023-02057-y)
> *Radiation in the water will be diluted to almost-background levels, but some researchers are not sure this will be sufficient to mitigate the risks*

- "...
Japan is pressing ahead with plans to release water [contaminated](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/contaminate) by the 2011 meltdown of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant into the Pacific Ocean.
...
Jim Smith, ..., says the risk this poses to nations around the Pacific Ocean will probably be [negligible](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/negligible).
...
 But Richmond is concerned the tritium could [concentrate](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/concentrate) in the food web as larger organisms eat smaller contaminated ones.
...
Shigeyoshi Otosaka says that the organically bound form of tritium could [accumulate](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/accumulate) in fish and marine organisms.
...
“We have confirmed that the tritium concentrations in the bodies of marine organisms reach [equilibrium](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/equilibrium) after a certain period of time and do not exceed the concentrations in the living environment,” the spokesperson said.

#### Three ways ChatGPT helps me in my academic writing [(Dritjon Gruda, 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-01042-3)
> *Generative AI can be a valuable aid in writing, editing and peer review – if you use it responsibly, says Dritjon Gruda.*

- "...
  The value that I [derive](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/derive) from generative AI is not from the technology itself blindly [churning out](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/churn-out) text, but from [engaging](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/engage) with the tool and using my own expertise to refine what it produces. The dialogue between me and the chatbot both enhances the [coherence](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/coherence) of my work and, over time, teaches me how to describe complex topics in a simper way.
  ...
  If something doesn’t quite hit the mark, don’t hesitate to say, “This isn’t quite what I meant. Let’s adjust this part.” Or you can commend its improvements: “This is much clearer, but let’s [tweak](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/tweak) the ending for a stronger transition to the next section.”
  ...
  For instance, ChatGPT excels at explaining and justifying the reasons behind specific limitations that I had identified in my review, which helps me to [grasp](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/grasp) the broader implications of the study’s contribution. If I identify methodological limitations, ChatGPT can [elaborate](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/elaborate) on these in detail and suggest ways to overcome them in a revision. ... Occasionally, however, its suggestions are [off-base](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/off-base), [far-fetched](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/far-fetched), irrelevant or simply wrong.
  ...
  ChatGPT has become [indispensable](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/indispensable) in this process, helping me to [craft](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/craft) precise, empathetic and actionable feedback without replacing human editorial decisions.
  ...
  I’ve found that this approach both enhances the quality of my feedback and helps to guarantee that I [convey](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/convey) my thoughts supportively.
  ...
  These tools can [bolster](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/bolster) our capabilities in writing, reviewing and editing. They preserve the essence of scientific inquiry — curiosity, critical thinking and innovation — while improving how we communicate our research.

#### An open letter to graduate students and other procrastinators: it’s time to write [(Dennis J. Hazelett, 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-025-02584-1)
- "...
  This letter is for the graduate student who has been asked by peers to begin writeup of a recent series of experiments. This person doesn't known where to begin and has received or absorbed a lot of free and [unsolicited](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/unsolicited) advice — including what order to write in, how to arrange their office and schedule to maximize productivity, and perhaps some tips on self-care. ... But you may approach the act of writing science with [reluctance](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/reluctance), as [nuisance](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/nuisance) or [distraction](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/distraction) from the 'real', hands-on, day-to-day work.
  ..., it may seem at times an [insurmountable](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/insurmountable) challenge to get started.
  ...
  Quite the opposite: scientific writing is an iterative process in which ideas become more [succinct](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/succinct) and more [cogent](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/cogent) each time you pass over them.
  ...
  All this really means is that there is no other way to tackle the largest tasks in life other than in the [increment](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/increment) of work available to you, which may indeed be discouragingly small. But there is hope.
  ...
  The second hard truth I have for you is this: thinking about your project in this way is actually a form of [procrastination](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/procrastination) — quite possibly the most damaging kind. The only kind of thinking that matters in science is structured thinking. The only way to give structure and substance to your thoughts is to write them down. Writing. Is. Thinking.
  ..., Get as far away from these people as possible. Anyone can write; it just takes practice. Regardless of your situation, you can still write for yourself, and your voice is great. ... A rule of thumb is that your drafts should get shorter with each iteration.
  ...
  Another reason why reading is hard, especially when it comes to technical papers, is that the vast majority of them are poorly written.
  ...
  Sitting through a scientific talk is generally challenging, for the same reason that reading most papers is. They’re often prepared without much due given to the basic questions I posed at the beginning of this essay: what is it you mean to say, and to whom are you saying it? When you fail to communicate effectively, in any medium, you’ve wasted your time and that of others. Worse still, you’ve missed out on a precious opportunity to promote your work and that of your colleagues and mentors. The bottom line is: writing is the most essential activity of a scientist because without writing there is no thinking and no real opportunity for exchange in the marketplace of ideas.

#### Book
#### The Book of Why: The New Science of Cause and Effect [(Judea Pearl and Dana Mackenzie, 2018)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Book_of_Why)
- "Causal inference is all about taking this question seriously. It [posits](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/posit) that the human brain is the most advanced tool ever [devised](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/devise) for managing causes and effects. Our brains store an incredible amount of causal knowledge which, supplemented by data, we could [harness](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/harness) to answer some of the most [pressing](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/pressing) questions of our time. More ambitiously, once we really understand the logic behind causal thinking, we could [emulate](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/emulate) it on modern computers and create an “artificial scientist.” This smart robot would discover yet unknown phenomena, find explanations to pending scientific [dilemmas](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/dilemma), design new experiments, and continually extract more causal knowledge from the environment."
